The “router” file in the top level is the executable, whereas the “src” directory contains the source files for my assignment. 

In order to build the executable yourself, you want to run “source build_executable.sh”.

After the executable is successfully built, you may invoke the program with:
	router test/<test name>
Note that <test name> should be any valid test file name inside “tests” directory.
